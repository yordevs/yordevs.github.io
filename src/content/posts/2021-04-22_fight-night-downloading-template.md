One of the first challenges you will encounter when participating in our CSS Fight Night will be downloading the answer template on to your computer. It’s a skill that’s often taken for granted, but actually downloading a project and running it locally can be difficult to figure out without direction, this article is here to support you through this process, giving you step by step instructions to get the template onto your computer.

# 1. Download VSCode

Visual Studio Code is currently one of the go to IDEs for web development, you can download it here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Once Visual Studio Code is installed, open it.

# 2. Go to the github repo and copy the link

Grab the git link to pull the template code by going to our repository on github (https://github.com/yordevs/CSS-Fight-Night-Template), clicking on the download code button, and copying the https url.

Alternatively, you can copy the link below

```

# 3. In VSCode navigate to the git tab and select clone repository

In the left hand side bar, click on the git tab (third from the top), then, in the git tab, click the “Clone Repository” button
