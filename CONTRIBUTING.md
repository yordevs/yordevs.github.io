# Contributing to yordevs.com

Thanks for you interest in contributing to the Yordevs site!

When doing so, we ask that you follow the guidelines below:

## Writing Commits

When writing commits use the **present/imperative tense**, and make sure the message is **descriptive** enough.

**‚úî Good**

```
Add new committee to Meet the team page
```

**‚ùå Bad**

```
Changed src/pages/team.js
```

Additionally, **please don't make too many commits**. If you can, bundle together similar changes into a single commit.

## Naming Branches

Please use the following naming convention when making new branches in this repo:

```
<issue number>_<description-separated-by-hyphens>
```

**Examples:**

```
455_responsive_footer

20_make-new-contact-form

1337_event-calendar-component
```

Please make sure the branch name is descriptive but not **overly long**; try and keep it to a maximum of 4-5 words.

## Creating Issues

Make sure your issue has a **concise but descriptive title**, and describe your problem in more detail inside the issue.  
f you're reporting a bug, the aim is to help us reproduce it on our end so we can fix it. If you're reporting a feature/enhancement, the aim to help us visualise this feature and why it might be good for the site.

**‚úî Good**

```
Event calendar not loading new events

When on the homepage the calendar doesn't show the latest events. It's stuck displaying the most recent event from 17th November.
```

**‚ùå Bad**

```
Homepage broken

The calendar isn't working
```

## Making Pull Requests

Similarly to commits, please write your PR title in the present/imperative tense, and describe what problem it fixes.  
Additionally, include the issue number its related to at the end of the title; this makes it easier to track which PRs are related to which issues.

In the PR's description, it would be helpful to write a brief summary of the changes you made, too.
